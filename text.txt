Here is the current list of **Core Functionalities** implemented in your multi-agent system, based on the finalized code:

---

### ✅ **Core Functionalities**

#### 1. **LangGraph Orchestration (`graph.py`)**

* Defines a **stateful workflow** using `StateGraph`
* Manages agent routing using **intent classification**
* Connects all agents and defines **entry + finish points**
* Handles **dynamic transitions** between nodes (multi-agent flow)

---

#### 2. **Natural Language Understanding (`nlu.py`)**

* Uses LLM to **detect user intent** (e.g., `sql`, `email`, `general`)
* Intent determines which agent should process the query
* Allows **open-ended user inputs** without hardcoded rules

---

#### 3. **Agent Framework (`agents/`)**

* Modular agents for handling specific tasks:

  * `sql_agent.py`: Generates SQL views
  * `email_agent.py`: Drafts professional emails
  * `general_agent.py`: Uses RAG to answer questions contextually
* Agents are **LLM-driven** and stateless (except for memory context)

---

#### 4. **Memory Management (`memory.py`)**

* Uses **LangChain's `ConversationBufferMemory`**
* Stores **multi-turn chat history**
* Enables **contextual understanding** across sessions
* Memory is passed through LangGraph as part of state

---

#### 5. **LLM Configuration (`llm.py`)**

* Uses **Databricks Llama Maverick 4** for LLM tasks
* Embedding model: `BGE-Large-EN` (via HuggingFace)
* Central LLM + embedding abstraction used across system

---

#### 6. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

* **Two-part system**:

  * `doc_loader.py`: Developer-controlled embedding & indexing
  * `rag.py`: Runtime document retrieval + QA over indexed content
* Enables **autonomous retrieval** when agent lacks answer context

---

#### 7. **Autonomous Knowledge Control**

* Agent automatically decides whether to use RAG based on intent (via `general_agent.py`)
* Decouples document processing (embedding) from query-time retrieval

---

#### 8. **Conversation Loop (`main.py`)**

* Accepts user input
* Maintains session memory
* Triggers graph execution
* Streams final agent response back to user

---

#### 9. **Extensibility**

* Easily add more agents (e.g., calendar, file handling, HR support)
* Swappable LLM backends
* Multi-user memory support (with session keys)

---

Let me know if you’d like to:

* Add new agent types
* Store memory in Redis or Chroma for persistence
* Enhance NLU with classification confidence or few-shot examples
* Visualize the LangGraph structure for debugging and documentation
