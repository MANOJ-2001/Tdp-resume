I am designing a sophisticated, multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates multiple intelligent agents into a unified conversational interface. The system will be deployed via a Streamlit-based chatbot UI, which I will develop. I need assistance in architecting and implementing the backend logic for the following agents and capabilities:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Conversational RAG Agent (Knowledge Retrieval)
Purpose: To provide grounded, context-aware answers based on enterprise documents.
Functionality:
Ingest documents from an Azure Storage Container.
Perform chunking, embedding, and indexing using either Azure AI Search or LangChain-compatible vector stores.
Retrieve relevant content and generate responses using a RAG pipeline.
Ensure responses are traceable to source documents for transparency and compliance.
ðŸ”¹ 2. View Script Generation Agent (Policy-Aware SQL Generator)
Purpose: To dynamically generate SQL view scripts based on user input and organizational policies.
Functionality:
Accept user inputs such as table name, column names, and schema name.
Reference uploaded documents containing organization-specific policies and regulatory guidelines.
Generate SQL view scripts that comply with these rules.
Handle follow-up queries related to view creation, policy interpretation, or compliance validation.
ðŸ”¹ 3. Email Automation Agent
Purpose: To send contextually appropriate emails based on user queries.
Functionality:
Classify the userâ€™s intent and generate relevant email content.
Integrate with an email service (e.g., Microsoft Graph API or SMTP).
Automatically send the generated content to the userâ€™s email address.
ðŸ”¹ 4. JSON Generation & Validation Agent
Purpose: To create and validate complex JSON structures based on predefined rules.
Functionality:
Ingest a document containing detailed JSON schema rules and validation logic.
Generate JSON outputs based on user prompts.
Validate the generated JSON against the rules and provide feedback or corrections.
ðŸ”¹ 5. Intent Classification & Routing Layer
Purpose: To intelligently route user queries to the appropriate agent.
Functionality:
Use an LLM or lightweight classifier to detect user intent.
Route the query to one of the following:
RAG Agent (for knowledge retrieval)
SQL View Generator
Email Agent
JSON Validator
Ensure seamless transitions between agents within the same chat session.

ðŸ”¹ 6. To continuously improve the assistant, we include a user feedback loop.
 Feedback Collection:
â€¢	Users can rate responses using thumbs-up/down icons.
â€¢	Optional comments allow users to explain their feedback.


Storage & Usage:
â€¢	Feedback, along with the query, context, and response, is stored in Azure Storage.
â€¢	This data is used to:
â€¢	Improve document retrieval
â€¢	Identify gaps in the knowledge base
ðŸ”¹ Additional Requirements:
All agents must operate within a unified Streamlit interface.
The system should support multi-turn conversations and maintain context across interactions.
Document ingestion should be automated and scalable, supporting updates and re-indexing.
The architecture should be modular, allowing for future expansion (e.g., adding more agents or switching vector DBs).
Request:
Please provide a detailed implementation strategy, including:

Recommended most efficient tools, frameworks, and libraries for each agent.
Suggested architecture .
list all frequest asked questions related to these.
Best practices for integrating Azure AI Search or LangChain with Streamlit.
which tool is versioning, emedding and re-indexing
Security and access control considerations for email and document handling.
