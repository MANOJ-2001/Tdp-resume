Hi,

I hope you are doing fine. 
I am Manoj Sirigiri, a TDPier from the January 2024 batch. I am keen to select a few projects that I would love to work on after completing my TDP boot camp.

I am reaching out to you because I went through the job description on the job board and found that my skills and interests align closely with this project. I have hands-on experience with a few projects based on machine learning and the MERN stack. I am a great team player and have good knowledge of Python programming language. I am keen to learn new tech stacks and am already learning a few, like Spark and Azure.

Should you require any further information, please feel free to reach out to me. I am available for a conversation at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for considering my application.

Warm regards,
Manoj Sirigiri
