Hi Siddharth Prabhudas sir,

I am Manoj Sirigirigi, a TDPier from the Jan 2024 batch. I was instructed to select a few projects that I would love to work on after completing my TDP boot camp. I'm reaching out to you because I'm passionate about machine learning and Python. I have hands-on experience in data science and machine learning, having completed three projects in college. However, the job description specifies a TDPier in the Gurgaon location, while my base location is Hyderabad site 2. If that's acceptable, please consider me and kindly review my resume to learn more about me. 

Thank you.
